            <p>The Placement Cell of SMVITM has always strived to facilitate placement for its students through three areas – Career guidance, Pre-placement training, and Employment/Placement opportunities. Career guidance is given to the students through invited talks from people from various industries giving them an understanding of various sectors and industries that they have the scope in. They are also given orientations on preparations for competitive exams like GATE, GMAT, CAT, TOEFL through various coaching institutions, virtual resources, newsletters, etc. The College has signed MoU’s with various training partners to skill-up the students through Technical, Softskills, and Aptitude training to complement the knowledge gained from stream-related subjects to meet the demands and requirements from industries for the hiring process. Students have opportunities to apply for recruitment drives of Mass recruiters like Infosys, TCS, Wipro, Cognizant, etc along with mid-sized companies and start-ups across India. Being a VTU affiliated college, we are also supported by the VTU Centralized Placement Cell, through various learning portals, internship & job portals; assessment and training companies. Opportunities to find employment with local companies like Robosoft Technologies, Manipal Technologies, Niveus Solutions, Karmic Designs, etc, are also encouraged.</p>
